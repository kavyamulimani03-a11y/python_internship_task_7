📚 Student Records Management (Python Project)
📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to manage student records using Python dictionaries and JSON.

The program stores student details in a dictionary, performs operations like accessing, updating, deleting records, and then converts the data into JSON format.
It also saves the JSON data to a file and reads it back into Python.

This project helps understand data handling and file operations in Python.

🎯 Objectives

Create a Python script named student_records.py

Store student details using a dictionary

Access dictionary keys and values

Update and delete dictionary entries

Loop through dictionary data

Convert dictionary to JSON format

Save JSON data to a file

Read JSON data back into Python

Print clean and formatted output

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python 3.x

VS Code

Python json module

Terminal / Command Prompt

🚀 How to Run the Program

Ensure Python is installed.

Open the project folder in VS Code.

Open terminal inside VS Code.

Run the following command:

python student_records.py


The program will create a students.json file automatically.

🖥 Example Student Data Structure
student = {
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Kavya",
    "course": "Computer Science",
    "marks": 85
}

📄 Example JSON Output (students.json)
{
    "id": 101,
    "name": "Kavya",
    "course": "Computer Science",
    "marks": 85
}
